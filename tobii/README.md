The file adapter.screenshare.orig.js here should be identical to node_modules/adapterjs/publish/adapter.screenshare.js.
If they differ the corresponding changes should be made in the nw version of the file.

In the same way, detectRTC.orig.html should be identical to https://cdn.temasys.com.sg/skylink/extensions/detectRTC.html.
The only difference between detectRTC.orig.html and detectRTC.tobii.htmlshould be the extensionid.
